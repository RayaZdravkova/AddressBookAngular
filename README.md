Running the .NET API and AddressBookAngular Together: 
1. Keep API Running: Ensure your .NET API is running locally on its assigned port. 
2. Keep Angular Server Running: Keep your Angular development server running (ng serve) to serve the frontend. 
3. Access the Angular App: Visit http://localhost:4200 in your browser to interact with your Angular app that communicates with the local .NET API. 


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
